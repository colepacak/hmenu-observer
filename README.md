TODO:
* determine if List static method assignOpenState is redundant compared to openState setter
* change receiveNotification from switch to dynamic case to something like handleMessageThatMessageName
* improve Item hasChild and getChildOpenState combo
* add animation to opening/closing
* handle active trail

Done:
* have observers register to a certain channel
* handle closing open list
* determine if List property childIntendsToOpen should be getter/setter
