TODO:

* make option to pass in animation duration
* move classes to own module

Done:
* have observers register to a certain channel
* handle closing open list
* determine if List property childIntendsToOpen should be getter/setter
* determine if List static method assignOpenState is redundant compared to openState setter
* add animation to opening/closing
* change receiveNotification from switch to dynamic case to something like handleMessageThatMessageName
